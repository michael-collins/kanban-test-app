This means that the dimensions of the 3D model match the dimensions of the actual object or environment, and that the model can be used to simulate real-world scenarios or to produce physical objects through techniques such as 3D printing. Real-world scale is important in many fields, including architecture, product design, and animation, as it allows designers and artists to create accurate and realistic representations of real-world objects and environments.\nCategory: animation\nAssociated Material: undefined",
